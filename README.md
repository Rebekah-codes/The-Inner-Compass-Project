# The-Inner-Compass-Project

The Inner Compass is a website on Mental Health Awareness and has information, images and links that will help the user navigate with ease and access the information they need.

# Wireframes

I first made some mobile-focused wireframes, to give a basic understanding of how I wanted my layout to look and I would adjust the style of the website from there. I focused these as mobile-first so that I can adjust the website-size layout as I go.

#   Copilot usage for Brand name and Logo

I used the capabilities of Microsoft Copilot to create a logo for my brand name "The Inner Compass". I asked it to use the style of the compass to create an empathetic logo that would be simplistic and put accross the message quickly. I also had Microsoft copilot create these as translucent background png images so that they would fit on the site perfectly and not interrupt the colour scheme.

# Carousel

I used this code from Bootstrap for the carousel and added in the images linked to the carousel.

The out-sourced images that I have used in the Carousel are as follows:

# Compatibility Checks

I have also checked the website through "https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://rebekah-codes.github.io/The-Inner-Compass-Project/"

# Copilot checking screen sizing

I had Copilot check the site for the correct screen sizing and to see if it could find any compatibility issues between screen sizing and to fix any issues it may find, showing the appropriate code changes it made.
