# The-Inner-Compass-Project
The Inner Compass is a website on Mental Health Awareness and has information, images and links that will help the user navigate with ease and access the information they need.

# Wireframes

I first made some mobile-focused wireframes, to give a basic understanding of how I wanted my layout to look and I would adjust the style of the website from there. I focused these as mobile-first so that I can adjust the website-size layout as I go.

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/Readme images/wireframe.png" alt="Four smartphone wireframes display different mobile layouts for a mental health website. Each screen shows navigation menus, large titles, buttons, and grouped content blocks with headings and short paragraphs. The first screen features a central circular logo with navigation buttons above and below. Other screens show stacked content cards and navigation links. The environment is minimal and monochrome, emphasizing clear structure and accessibility. Visible text includes group name, a large title, a short paragraph explaining the brand idea, button, home, products, company, and blog. The overall tone is calm, organized, and user-friendly." />

#   Copilot usage for Brand name and Logo

I used the capabilities of Microsoft Copilot to create a logo for my brand name The Inner Compass. I asked it to use the style of the compass to create an empathetic logo that would be simplistic and put accross the message quickly. I also had Microsoft copilot create these as translucent background png images so that they would fit on the site perfectly and not interrupt the colour scheme.

# Carousel

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/Readme images/Bootstrap-Carousel.png" alt="Bootstrap documentation page displays a carousel component example. The main section shows a large gray carousel with centered text First slide. Below, HTML code for the carousel is visible, including div elements and image tags. The left sidebar lists Bootstrap components such as Accordion, Alerts, Badge, Breadcrumb, and Carousel, with Carousel highlighted. The right sidebar provides navigation links for carousel usage and options. The environment uses a dark theme with purple highlights, creating a focused and professional tone. No other visible text is present." />

I used this code from Bootstrap for the carousel and added in the images linked to the carousel.

The out-sourced images that I have used in the Carousel are as follows:

# Compatibility Checks

I have also checked the website through https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://rebekah-codes.github.io/The-Inner-Compass-Project/

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/Readme images/Am-I-responsive.png" alt="Four digital devices including a desktop monitor, laptop, tablet, and smartphone display The Inner Compass website homepage and services page. Screens show a neutral color palette with a compass logo, navigation menu, and mental health support service cards. The environment is a dark background that highlights the responsive design across devices. Visible text includes The Inner Compass, About, Services, Contact, Mental Health Support Services, Anxiety and Stress Management, Depression Support, Mindfulness-Based Therapy, Mental Health Awareness, and Navigate Your Mental Wellness. The overall tone is professional and reassuring." />

# Copilot checking screen sizing

I had Copilot check the site for the correct screen sizing and to see if it could find any compatibility issues between screen sizing and to fix any issues it may find, showing the appropriate code changes it made.

# Performance checks

I inspected the deployed webpage and checked the performance status given from this. Everything looks good and the images are compressed enough to not cause a problem.

<p align="center">

The screen displays a summary of performance metrics including scores for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. The environment is a clean, modern dashboard interface with a white background and green highlights indicating positive results. No visible text is present except for the metric categories and scores. The tone is efficient and reassuring." />
</p>

I have also checked for errors within the HTML and CSS using W3c to make sure my website is running properly and as it should

# Brand design, logo & favicon

I used Microsoft Copilot to help me come up with the brand-design and logo for "The Inner Compass".
They all came out simplistic and of the same colour scheme which are aesthetically pleasing to the eye.

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/images/logo.png" alt="logo for inner compass" />
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/images/favicon.png" alt="favicon for inner compass" />
</p>

This image was one used in the Carousel, but the colour scheme was also generated from this image for the logo and design throughout the rest of the website.

# Fun with cursors

I did some background research on google and some other sites on how to have a small moving icon follow around your mouse, much like a Compass would travel with you in your bag and show you the way when you needed it to. It also rotates clockwise, much like a real compass might rotate. It is coloured dark green to fit in with the colour scheme of the website too.

# Form submission

I took some inspiration from the forms on bootstrap to create my own form with a submission page, giving the data entry fields errors if they were not filled in correctly. I had copilot help me create a thank-you page with the appropriate response that should be given had the form be a real submission form, but without actually submitting real details anywhere for the safety of this project. Below is the page I took inspiration from, from the Bootstrap site, and used features from a couple of the different forms to achieve my end goal.

# Overall

The website is informative, interactive and can help the user navigate to sections they need or submit a form to get further help from a "dedicated team".
I have used Copilot to ensure my work is fully functional too, ensuring that links work and the likes.
