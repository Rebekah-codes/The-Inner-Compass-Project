# The-Inner-Compass-Project

The Inner Compass is a website on Mental Health Awareness and has information, images and links that will help the user navigate with ease and access the information they need.

# Wireframes

I first made some mobile-focused wireframes, to give a basic understanding of how I wanted my layout to look and I would adjust the style of the website from there. I focused these as mobile-first so that I can adjust the website-size layout as I go.

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/Readme images/wireframe.png" alt="Four smartphone wireframes display different mobile layouts for a mental health website. Each screen shows navigation menus, large titles, buttons, and grouped content blocks with headings and short paragraphs. The first screen features a central circular logo with navigation buttons above and below, while the others show stacked content cards and navigation links. The environment is minimal and monochrome, focusing on clear structure and accessibility. Visible text includes group name, a big title, small paragraph of text explaining the brand idea, button, home, products, company, and blog. The tone is calm and organized, emphasizing usability and clarity." />

#   Copilot usage for Brand name and Logo

I used the capabilities of Microsoft Copilot to create a logo for my brand name "The Inner Compass". I asked it to use the style of the compass to create an empathetic logo that would be simplistic and put accross the message quickly. I also had Microsoft copilot create these as translucent background png images so that they would fit on the site perfectly and not interrupt the colour scheme.

# Carousel

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/Readme images/Bootstrap-Carousel.png" alt="Bootstrap documentation page showing a carousel component example. The main section displays a large gray carousel with the text First slide centered. Below, HTML code for the carousel is visible, including div elements and image tags. The left sidebar lists Bootstrap components such as Accordion, Alerts, Badge, Breadcrumb, and Carousel, with Carousel highlighted. The right sidebar provides navigation links for carousel usage and options. The environment uses a dark theme with purple highlights, creating a focused and professional tone. No other visible text is present." />

I used this code from Bootstrap for the carousel and added in the images linked to the carousel.

The out-sourced images that I have used in the Carousel are as follows:

# Compatibility Checks

I have also checked the website through "https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://rebekah-codes.github.io/The-Inner-Compass-Project/"

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/Readme images/Am-I-responsive.png" alt="Four digital devices including a desktop monitor, laptop, tablet, and smartphone display The Inner Compass website homepage and services page. The screens show a calm, neutral color palette with a compass logo, navigation menu, and mental health support service cards. The environment is a dark background that highlights the responsive design across devices. Visible text includes The Inner Compass, About, Services, Contact, Mental Health Support Services, Anxiety and Stress Management, Depression Support, Mindfulness-Based Therapy, Mental Health Awareness, and Navigate Your Mental Wellness. The overall tone is professional and reassuring." />

# Copilot checking screen sizing

I had Copilot check the site for the correct screen sizing and to see if it could find any compatibility issues between screen sizing and to fix any issues it may find, showing the appropriate code changes it made.
