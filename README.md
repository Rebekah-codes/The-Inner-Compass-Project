# The-Inner-Compass-Project

The Inner Compass is a website on Mental Health Awareness and has information, images and links that will help the user navigate with ease and access the information they need.

I first made some mobile-focused wireframes, to give a basic understanding of how I wanted my layout to look and I would adjust the style of the website from there. I focused these as mobile-first so that I can adjust the website-size layout as I go.

I used the capabilities of Microsoft Copilot to create a logo for my brand name "The Inner Compass". I asked it to use the style of the compass to create an empathetic logo that would be simplistic and put accross the message quickly. I also had Microsoft copilot create these as translucent background png images so that they would fit on the site perfectly and not interrupt the colour scheme.
